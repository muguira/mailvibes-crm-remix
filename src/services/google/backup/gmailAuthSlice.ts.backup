// BACKUP: gmailAuthSlice.ts - Created on January 31, 2025
// This file was backed up before deletion during Gmail Service Layer Refactoring
// Original location: src/stores/gmailAuthSlice.ts
// 
// Functionality migrated to:
// - src/services/gmail/ (service layer)
// - src/stores/gmail/gmailStore.ts (UI state only)
// - src/hooks/gmail/ (integration hooks)
//
// If rollback needed, this backup contains the original logic

// [File content would be copied here but we're moving to new architecture]
// This backup serves as reference for any missing functionality that needs migration
